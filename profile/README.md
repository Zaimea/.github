## About Zaimea.com

`Zaimea` started from a simple need: digitally tracking working hours in a reliable and accessible way. Over time, the platform evolved based on real-world requirements, expanding its features and capabilities.

Our main focus is `groups.zaimea.com`, a system designed to help manage work schedules, hours, and organization more efficiently. Alongside the core platform, Zaimea also provides several open-source Laravel packages, created to solve common development challenges and to support the Laravel community.
